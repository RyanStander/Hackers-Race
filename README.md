# Hackers-Race
Try to steal the data before others can

How to use:

Changing music:
- Find the Music folder in streamingassets in Hacker Race_Data
- place any song inside, and delete the old ones.
- When you enter the game, it should play the new song

Gameplay Mechanics:
- WASD to move
- Space to jump
- Right click to dash up to 3 times
- eyeballs are sentries that if you run into them you will lose
- falling out of the cloud will make you lose (out of map)
- try to reach the end of the course to be able to enter a time
- large white panels are backdoors that if you go fast enough you can go past, these allow alternative routes
- skipping parts of the course to finish faster is encouraged (usual minimum time 15 seconds, below is impressive, average should be around 30 seconds)
